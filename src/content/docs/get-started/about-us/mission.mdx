At the 2077 Collective, our mission is to bridge the gap between Ethereum's technical prowess and its public perception. We recognize the need for a coordinated marketing strategy to showcase the ecosystem's innovations and drive broader adoption.

## Our Core Objectives

- **Consensus Building**: We aim to facilitate discussions and reach a collective agreement on the key marketing challenges facing the Ethereum community.
- **Infrastructure Development**: We will build public tools and resources to support the implementation of effective marketing campaigns for the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **Promotion & Outreach**: Through strategic marketing efforts, we strive to increase awareness of Ethereum's capabilities, attract more developers and businesses to the platform, and foster mainstream adoption.
  By aligning the community's efforts and amplifying Ethereum's message, we believe we can unlock the full potential of this transformative blockchain technology.

## Projects

As an open-source community focused on Ethereum development and research, we maintain several projects, including:

- **Etherpedia**: A beginner-friendly online encyclopedia about blockchain technology and Ethereum.
- **EIP Wiki**: A resource providing easy-to-understand explanations of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).
- **2077 Research**: Cutting-edge research and analysis on Ethereum developments.
