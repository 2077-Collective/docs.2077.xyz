## Introduction

Welcome to the 2077 Collective! The Writing and Research Guilds are essential to our initiative and dedicated to producing high-quality content that informs, educates, and engages the Ethereum community. This handbook will guide you through the structure, processes, and opportunities within these (#writing & #research) Guilds, ensuring you can contribute effectively and make a meaningful impact. Before you onboard, please familiarize yourself with how the Guilds are structured.

## Guild Structure

### Guild Leads

The Writing and Research Guilds are led by a common Guild Lead who oversees activities, reviews submissions, and provides guidance. The Guild Lead ensures that all content meets the collective’s standards and aligns with the broader goals of the Ethereum community.

### Writing Guild

The Writing Guild focuses on producing written content that ranges from detailed research reports to more accessible articles and scripts. Contributors in this Guild work on the following:

- **[Etherpedia](https://etherpedia.2077.xyz):** Accessible info for all levels, fun reads, coverage of emerging tech and innovations
- **Long-form X threads**
- **Video scripts**

### Research Guild

The Research Guild delves into deep, technical research and produces comprehensive reports and educational materials. Key areas of focus include:

- **[2077 Research](https://research.2077.xyz):** World-class reports on anything Ethereum, explore edge cases, challenges, proposal implementations, etc.
- **EIPs for Nerds (part of 2077 Research):** Go into the weeds and explain how new EIPs work.
- **[EIPs Wiki](https://eips.wiki):** Digestible and consumable articles with illustrations, explaining different EIPs and their impact.

### Step 4: Onboard into Charmverse

Charmverse is the platform where tasks are available for all Contributors, including those in the writing and research guilds. Follow these steps to onboard:

### Step 5: Introduce Yourself on Discord

Once you have completed the Google form and onboarded into Charmverse, go to the #introduce-yourself channel on Discord. Introduce yourself, share what you do, and any relevant information about yourself. This will help you connect with other Contributors and start interacting within the community.

### Step 6: Start Contributing

After introducing yourself, continue to interact in the Discord channels and start contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem. Check Charmverse regularly for available tasks, pick ones that match your interests and skills, and apply them to work on them. Can’t find a suitable task for yourself? — Contributors can propose content ideas in the respective Guild (say, #writing) or in the #ideas channel of the 2077 Collective Discord server (if they cannot find a suitable Guild). They must tag the Guild Lead for a timely response. The community reviews these ideas to decide which ones to pursue.

## Contributing to the Guilds

### Proposing Ideas

If you have an idea for content that doesn’t fall into the existing categories, you can propose it in the #ideas channel on Discord. Tag the Guild Lead and present your idea for discussion. The community will review and provide feedback on your proposal.

### Forming Squads

To work on a specific topic or project:

1. Post a message in the relevant Guild channel (Writing or Research) on Discord, signaling your interest.
2. Tag the Guild Lead to initiate a discussion.
3. Form a Squad with other interested Contributors. Squads can consist of one or more members and can be temporary or long-term.
4. Once the idea is approved, the Squad can start working on the project.

### Submission and Review Process

Complete your content and submit it for review. The Guild Lead will review your submission, provide feedback, and ensure it meets the collective’s standards. Approved content will be published and shared within the Ethereum community.
