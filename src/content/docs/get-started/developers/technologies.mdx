## Technology Stack

**Active GitHub projects utilize the following technologies:**

- **JavaScript**: Used for client-side scripting and creating interactive web pages. We follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

- **Astro**: A modern front-end framework for building fast and scalable websites. We adhere to the [official Astro style guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/).

- **Python**: Used for server-side scripting, data analysis, and automation tasks. We follow the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and use type hints for better code readability and maintainability.

**Other stacks we utilize for disparate projects include:**

- **Web Development**: HTML/Tailwind. Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first CSS styling, ensuring rapid and responsive design.

- **Web Analytics**: We use cloud-hosted version of [plausible.io](https://plausible.io/) to count visitors on our websites.

- **Full-Stack Development**: JavaScript/TypeScript. TypeScript is preferred for its static type-checking capabilities, enhancing code quality and reducing runtime errors.

- **Backend Development**: Python. We leverage frameworks like Django and Flask for robust and scalable backend solutions.

- **Smart-Contract Development**: Solidity. We use Solidity for developing smart contracts on blockchain platforms, following best practices for security and efficiency.

By leveraging these technologies, we ensure our projects are built with modern, efficient, and maintainable codebases, tailored to meet the specific needs of each project.
