To maintain consistency in our codebase, we follow these basic style guidelines:

### General:

- Ensure code is well-commented for clarity and maintainability.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Write unit tests for critical functions and components.
- Follow the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) for object-oriented design.
- Review and adhere to [DRY principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (Don't Repeat Yourself).

### JavaScript:

- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `userName`).
- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `UserClass`).
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).
- Keep lines under 80 characters.
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var` for variable declarations.
- Use strict equality (`===`) and inequality (`!==`) to avoid type coercion issues.
- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

### Astro:

- Follow the official [Astro style guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/).
- Ensure all components are self-contained and reusable.
- Use consistent naming conventions for component files and functions.

### Python:

- Use snake_case for variable and function names (e.g., `user_name`).
- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `UserClass`).
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).
- Keep lines under 79 characters.
- Follow the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- Ensure docstrings are provided for all public modules, classes, functions, and methods ([PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)).
- Utilize type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.

### HTML/CSS:

- Use lowercase letters and hyphens for class names (e.g., `user-name`).
- Use double quotes for attribute values.
- Keep HTML and CSS code well-formatted and readable.
- Follow the [W3C HTML and CSS guidelines](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss).

### Git:

- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention.
- Regularly pull changes from the main branch to stay up-to-date.
- Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all tests pass before merging to the main branch.

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure a clean, consistent, and maintainable codebase across the 2077 Collective projects.
